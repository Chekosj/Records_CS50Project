RECORDS - How to use

Youtube Video Presenting Project: https://youtu.be/cXwjNdtwWhY


First, go into the "Project/" folder and then type into the terminal "flask run."
After doing so, click on the link and it should take you to the appropriate site.

The first page that you will see is the index page, which shows you the most recent
records that have been made on the website. These records update every time someone creates
a new record and inputs it into the site. You will see a vinyl record with the title of the
song in bold and underneath the title of the song, you will see the artist. Then, under the
hole in the middle, you will see the date that this record took place, or the day of
the specific memory that they have with that song. You are not able to read their memories;
however, because as of now they are private. If you click on the white letters under the
records, the website will automatically scroll down to the next record, and when it reaches
the third record, you will be able to reach the top just by clicking the white letters above the vinyl.

In order to create a record, simply click "Make a Record" on the menu bar. Then you will be prompted
to input a song, an artist, a date, and a memory. You must input every element or else the program
will not let you click "Record". After inputting all of these elements, the site will take you to your
timeline when you will be able to see all your submissions in chronological order based on the day
that you assigned each element.

If you click on the Logo in the menu bar, it will redirect you to the homepage, where you will see that
your submission has replaced a previous submission as the most recent submission. If someone else
were to submit a record after you, their submission would take the top record and yours would be moved
to the second record.
